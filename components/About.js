          Ever since I was young, I've had a passion for making things. This
          aspiration for creation has taken me down a lot of different paths,
          from crafting art in a variety of mediums, to cooking overwhelming
          amounts of food, and even building homes for the homeless. <br /> I
          took advantage of every learning opportunity possible, networking my
          way into positions at Whole Foods, Churchill Downs, and more. After
          lots of thought, and encouragement from my family, I decided to sign
          up at Code Louisville. With their guidance, I joined the exciting
          world of Web Development! I have experience in C# .NET, Full Stack
          JavaScript, and more. When I'm not honing these skills, you can find
          me building playlists, filling sketchbooks, and running around the
          neighborhood with my dog. Hope to connect with you soon!{' '}
